### Objectives

Build fully distributed Hadoop on the cluster formed by these four VMs.

## SSH Passphrase Free Connection

**For each VM**, type the following command in the terminal to generate a pair of RSA keys (i.e., public key and private key):

`ssh-keygen`

Then press "enter key" for file and passphrase, which means setting these values as default.
